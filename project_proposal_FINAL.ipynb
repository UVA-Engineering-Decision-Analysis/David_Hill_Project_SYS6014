    "Title: Optimizing the Aquisition of Heavy Equiptment for Small Businesses\n",

    "In the real estate industry, there is a huge opportunity for digital transformation. Moreover, there is a strong need for data driven analysis tools to empower small to medium-sized real estate companies to realize their fullest potential. With this project I would like to introduce a decision analysis tool to help real estate development companies evaluate key business decisions namely relating to the acquisition of real-estate development equiptment. The target decision maker for this tool is the owner or executive of a small-medium sized real-estate development company. For companies of this nature, financial resources are often limited so it is imperitive for them to make a wise decision regarding the acquisition of heavy equiptment. Often times this equiptment is very expensive to buy and a decision of whether to lease or buy is critical to the longevity of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "A poor acquisition decision can lead to project failure, injury to personnel and significant loss of capital which can be crippling to a small business. Thus, the approach of this tool will be to provide a classic rent versus buy analysis based on the decision maker's access to capital, financial posture, and goals. The innovation of this tool is in the inclusion of equiptment condition based on age and use in the decision model. This will provide a propability of catastrophic failure to various categoriztions of equiptment so the decision maker not only knows whether to rent or buy but also what condition of equiptment they should seek.\n",
