# Real Estate Equipment Acquisition Analysis Tool
A decision analysis tool to aid real estate investors in the acquisition of development equiptment

### Description

**The goal of this project is to create a data-driven decision making tool to enable real-estate development business owners to make the optimal decision for acquiring heavy equipment such as bulldozers and tractors. Given the high cost of such equiptment, it is important to make a decision that is not only cost effective, but also of low risk. This paper describes a decision analysis tool that augments a classic rent vs finance vs buy analysis for a given piece of heavy equiptment with a prediction tool that predicts the chance of catastrophic failure during the time periods of use.**
