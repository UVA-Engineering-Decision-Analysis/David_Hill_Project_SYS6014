    "# Real Estate Equipment Acquisition Analysis Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real estate industry, there is a huge opportunity for digital transformation. Moreover, there is a strong need for data driven analysis tools to empower small to medium-sized real estate companies to realize their fullest potential. With this project I would like to build a decision analysis tool to help real estate development companies evaluate key business decisions to improve their business operations and customer services. Cash flow and profit/loss analysis will be central to this decision analysis tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Decision Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who is the decision-maker?\n",
    "    * The owners and decision makers of small-medium sized real estate companies\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* What decision does this agent confront?\n",
    "    * Real Estate Developer:\n",
    "        * The acquisition of development equipment.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "* What is the set of options (or potential actions) from which this decision-maker chooses? \n",
    "    * Real Estate Developer\n",
    "        * Acquire or don’t Acquire development equipment (rent)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "* What are the stakes of the decision? What real costs and benefits are realized from making better vs. poorer decisions?\n",
    "    * Real Estate Developer\n",
    "        * Equipment may malfunction and may incur maintenance/repair costs\n",
    "            * Cost of Equipment VS Renting\n",
    "            * Long term benefit (Lower cost of development).\n",
    "            \n",
    "### The Predictive Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "What information does your chosen predictive tool provide?\n",
    "* It provides insights to business owners as to what strategic business decisions to make in order to grow their business. \n",
    "\n",
    "How will the decision maker use the information generated by this tool to make better decisions?\n",
    "* The tool will be used in the development of their strategic business development or expansion plan which they can execute on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal in this analysis is to derive a model that maximizes the value of acquiring a piece of development equipment while minimizing the risk as a function of cost. Essentially, we want the biggest bang for our buck. We will use a bulldozer as an example of a piece of development equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formal Description\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "The decision-maker's action set $\\ A:$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2} ,..., \\alpha_{n} \\in \\ A$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ A = \\{\\alpha_{1} = 1, \\alpha_{2} = 0\\}$\n",

    "The state space: $\\ X$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\chi_{1}, \\chi_{2} ,..., \\chi_{n} \\in \\ X$\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Data Generating Process\n",
    "\n",
    "As a part of the data generation process, we will look at data provided by Komatsu, a reputable bulldozer supplier. We will also be scraping bulldozer data as needed from websites we find.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Prior Beliefs\n",
    "\n",
    "One assumption the client has is that buying a new bulldozer will result in higher productivity due to a lessened need to transport the bulldozer frequently. It is also assumed that the probability that a new bulldozer will malfunction is lower than that of a used rented one. It is finally assumed that a rented bulldozer has lower maintenance costs. However, the new bulldozer is expected to have a higher payoff as it helps vertically integrate the client’s business. The bulldozer can be classified as an asset to the business which can enable tax benefits and enhanced operational capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Getting Better Information\n",
    "\n",
    "We will sharpen the decision maker’s beliefs by performing Bayesian analysis on collected bulldozer data that we will collect and/or simulate. This data will show us the estimated work hours we can get from different classes of bulldozers, as well as repair cost data. More data and research in this topic may reveal other unobserved parameters that need to be accounted for. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Payoffs\n",
    "* Buying\n",
    "    * Higher productivity and utility from the equipment.\n",
    "    * Lower long-term cost of owning the equipment\n",
    "    * Growth enabler of the business and improved operational capabilities\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Renting\n",
    "    * Less risk in the case of a malfunction. \n",
    "    * Can use as needed and will remove liability from the real estate business owner.\n",
    "  \n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Utility/Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility function for this project will be a function of the user’s action and the parameter relating to its chance to need a costly maintenance. It is important for the utility function to incorporate cost as the cost of a repair and the cost of ownership/leasing should not exceed the value or payoff we get from a particular decision\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one decision can be made. Once chosen, the outcome of said choice is immutable"
